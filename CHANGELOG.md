## v1.3.2
- Emission Presets will no longer touch `Post Processing -> PP Animations` since they are supposed to be animated by the user. Sorry about that!

## v1.3.1
- Some properties on some Shading Presets were configured incorrectly, so they were fixed. Sorry about that!

## v1.3.0
## REBUILD YOUR PRESETS CACHE FOR THIS RELEASE!! To do this, click `Thry -> Presets -> Rebuild Cache` in the Unity Menu Bar.

- Added `Shading/Anime Style Redux`, a hybrid Cartoon Rim Lighting styled Shading Preset. If you play Genshin Impact or similar Anime-styled games, this Preset might look familiar to you.
- Added `For World Creators/Emulate Standard Shader`. This Preset will directly emulate the shading properties similar to Unity's Standard Shader, for those who wish to use Poiyomi World's features in World Projects.
- Changed the category `Patches` to `Quick Fixes` since that makes a bit more sense to me.
- Changed the category `Special FX/Grab Pass` to `Special FX/Grab Pass (Requires Poiyomi Grab Pass)`, just in case the user didn't know the Preset required using the Poyiomi Grab Pass variant (and a subtle reminder that Grab Pass is now available in the Free version).
- Updated README.md.

## v1.2.2
- Changed `Shading/Blu's Shading Setup` to reflect my latest settings.
- Fixed `Shading/Faint Eye Reflection [Clear Coat]` from not having the correct Preset tags. It should work now!
- Fixed incorrect properties on `Shading/Toon Gradient` Preset.

## v1.2.1
- Added Glasses Refraction preset. best suited for glasses. Uses Poiyomi Grab Pass, so use it wisely!
- Added a Preset enabling cool AudioLink Spectrum Bars. I think it looks wicked!

## v1.2.0

- Updated README.md.

## v1.1.0
- Added Basic Dissolve AudioLink Preset.
